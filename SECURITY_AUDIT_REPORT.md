# Security Audit Report
**Date:** October 29, 2024  
**Scope:** WordPress Plugin (Frontend) + Node.js Backend API

## üö® Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Resend API Key in Configuration
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**File:** `backend/render-phase2.yaml`  
**Line:** 63

**Issue:**
- Real Resend API key was hardcoded in configuration file: `re_RvKoP4WQ_GWCmmWA3NPJPyN8f4xQ2FTqU`
- This file is tracked in git and was committed to repository
- Key was exposed in GitHub history

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed hardcoded key
- Changed to `sync: false` with documentation comment
- Added note to set key in Render dashboard instead

**Required Action:**
1. **ROTATE THE API KEY IMMEDIATELY**
   - Visit: https://resend.com/api-keys
   - Revoke key: `re_RvKoP4WQ_GWCmmWA3NPJPyN8f4xQ2FTqU`
   - Generate new key
   - Update in Render dashboard environment variables

2. **Verify Git History:**
   - Check if key was exposed in previous commits
   - Consider using `git-filter-repo` or GitHub's secret scanning if needed

---

### 2. Environment Files Not Properly Ignored
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Files:** `render-env-vars.txt`

**Issue:**
- Environment variable template files were tracked in git
- While only containing placeholders, this is still a security risk

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `render-env-vars.txt` and `*-env-vars.txt` to `.gitignore`
- Removed from git tracking using `git rm --cached`
- Updated both frontend and backend `.gitignore` files

---

## ‚úÖ Security Best Practices Found

### Good Practices:
1. **Environment Variables:**
   - No `.env` files are tracked in git
   - Backend uses `sync: false` for sensitive values in `render-phase2.yaml`
   - Database URLs are not hardcoded

2. **API Keys:**
   - OpenAI API keys are passed as parameters, not hardcoded
   - Stripe keys use placeholders in documentation
   - JWT secrets use `generateValue: true` for auto-generation

3. **Git Configuration:**
   - `.env` files are properly ignored
   - `node_modules` are ignored
   - Build artifacts are ignored

4. **Code Security:**
   - API authentication uses Bearer tokens (JWT)
   - No passwords stored in plain text (uses bcrypt)
   - Rate limiting implemented for sensitive endpoints

---

## üìã Additional Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **Rotate Resend API Key** (see above)
2. ‚úÖ **Update .gitignore files** (completed)
3. ‚úÖ **Remove sensitive files from git tracking** (completed)

### Ongoing Security:
1. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning:**
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Secret scanning
   - Enable automatic scanning for exposed secrets

2. **Review Repository Access:**
   - Limit who has write access to repository
   - Use branch protection rules

3. **Environment Variable Management:**
   - Never commit real API keys or secrets
   - Use Render dashboard or environment variable management tools
   - Document required variables in `env.example` files

4. **Regular Audits:**
   - Run security audits before major releases
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan for secrets
   - Review git history for exposed credentials

5. **Backend Security:**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enforced
   - Implement CORS properly
   - Use rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Keep dependencies updated

## üìä Summary

**Total Issues Found:** 2  
**Critical:** 1 (Hardcoded API key)  
**Medium:** 1 (Environment file tracking)  
**All Issues:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Status:** üîí **SECURE** (after key rotation)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Hardcoded API keys removed from code
- [x] Environment files added to .gitignore
- [x] Sensitive files removed from git tracking
