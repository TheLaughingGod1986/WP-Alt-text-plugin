## Security Checklist

### ✅ Input Sanitization
- [x] All user input sanitized with `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_email()`, `sanitize_key()`, `intval()`
- [x] SQL queries use `$wpdb->prepare()` for prepared statements
- [x] File paths sanitized with `plugin_dir_path()` and `wp_basename()`
- [x] Array inputs validated with `is_array()` checks

### ✅ Output Escaping
- [x] All HTML output uses `esc_html()`, `esc_html_e()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- [x] JSON output uses `wp_json_encode()` and `esc_attr()` for data attributes
- [x] REST API responses properly formatted with WordPress functions

### ✅ CSRF Protection
- [x] All AJAX handlers use `check_ajax_referer()` with proper nonce
- [x] 15 AJAX endpoints verified to have nonce checks
- [x] Direct checkout links use `wp_verify_nonce()`
- [x] REST API uses WordPress nonce system

### ✅ Capability Checks
- [x] All AJAX handlers check `user_can_manage()` or `current_user_can('edit_posts')`
- [x] REST API endpoints have `permission_callback` functions
- [x] Admin-only functionality properly gated

### ✅ SQL Injection Prevention
- [x] All database queries use `$wpdb->prepare()`
- [x] Table names validated via `self::table()` method
- [x] No raw SQL with user input concatenation

### ✅ XSS Prevention
- [x] All user-facing output escaped
- [x] JavaScript variables use `wp_json_encode()` or `esc_attr()`
- [x] Error messages sanitized before display

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Passwords never stored locally (handled by backend API)
- [x] JWT tokens stored securely in WordPress transients
- [x] API credentials never exposed in frontend code
- [x] Backend API handles sensitive operations

### ✅ File Security
- [x] Direct file access prevented with `ABSPATH` check
- [x] Plugin files not executable
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in codebase

## Remaining Items Removed/Cleaned

1. ✅ **Author URI** - Removed from plugin header
2. ✅ **Donate Link** - Removed from readme.txt
3. ✅ **Verbose Console Logs** - Reduced to essential error logging only
4. ✅ **SQL Query** - Fixed in `class-queue.php` (removed incorrect `prepare()` usage)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (nonces, capability checks, sanitization)
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only perform actions they're authorized for
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated before processing
4. **Output Escaping**: All outputs escaped appropriately
5. **Secure Defaults**: Safe defaults for all settings

- ✅ All AJAX handlers have nonce verification
- ✅ All REST endpoints have permission checks
- ✅ All SQL queries use prepared statements
- ✅ All user output is escaped
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
