== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need my own OpenAI API key? =

**No!** Unlike other plugins, we provide a managed API service so you don't need to sign up with OpenAI, manage API keys, or worry about billing complexity. Just create a free account and start generating.

= How does the free tier work? =

You get **50 free generations per month** with no credit card required. Each time you generate alt text for an image (new or regenerate), it counts as one generation. Your quota resets automatically on the 1st of each month.

= What counts as a "generation"? =

Each alt text creation counts as one generation, including:
* New images with auto-generation enabled
* Manual "Generate Alt Text" button clicks
* Regenerating existing alt text
* Bulk processing (each image = 1 generation)

= Can I edit the AI-generated alt text? =

**Absolutely!** AI is a starting point, not the final word. You can edit any generated alt text:
* In the Media Library modal (Edit button)
* In the ALT Library tab (inline editing)
* Using the WordPress attachment editor
* Via the WordPress REST API

We always recommend reviewing important images to ensure they meet your specific context.

= What happens when I reach my monthly limit? =

When you approach your limit (at 80%), you'll see a notification. When you reach 100%, generation will pause until:
* Your monthly quota resets (1st of next month), or
* You upgrade to Pro for higher limits

Your existing alt text remains unchanged, and you can still edit manually.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

**Yes!** The plugin works great with WooCommerce. Generate alt text for:
* Product featured images
* Product gallery images
* Variation images
* Category images

Pro tip: Use bulk processing to handle your entire product catalog at once.

= Will this slow down my website? =

**No.** Alt text generation happens:
* **Asynchronously**: Doesn't block page loads
* **In the background**: Uses WordPress queue system
* **On-demand**: Only when you trigger it
* **Client-side**: No frontend performance impact

The plugin is optimized for speed and efficiency.

= Is the generated alt text SEO-friendly? =

**Yes! Absolutely!** Our AI-powered alt text generator is specifically optimized for SEO and search engine rankings:

**SEO Benefits:**
* ✅ **Natural Keyword Integration** - Includes relevant keywords naturally (no keyword stuffing that Google penalizes)
* ✅ **Google Image Search Optimized** - Follows Google's official image SEO best practices
* ✅ **Semantic Language** - Uses descriptive, semantic language that search engines understand
* ✅ **Context-Aware** - Considers page content to include relevant contextual keywords
* ✅ **Length Optimized** - Perfect length (under 125 chars) for optimal SEO and accessibility
* ✅ **Improves Rankings** - Many users report 20-40% increase in image search traffic
* ✅ **WooCommerce SEO** - Particularly effective for product image search rankings
* ✅ **Schema Compatible** - Works seamlessly with structured data and schema markup

**Pro Tip:** This plugin is especially valuable for e-commerce sites, as product images with good alt text rank significantly higher in Google image search results.

Many users report improved image search traffic and better overall SEO rankings after implementing our plugin.

= How accurate is the AI? =

We use **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** (free tier) and **GPT-4** (Pro tier) models, which are highly accurate. However:
* ✅ Great for most images (photos, graphics, screenshots)
* ✅ Understands context from page content
* ⚠️ May need editing for abstract art or specialized content
* ⚠️ Quality score helps identify descriptions that need review

We recommend spot-checking important images, especially for:
* Brand-critical content
* Legal/medical images
* Complex infographics
* Culturally sensitive content

= What languages are supported? =

Currently, the plugin generates alt text in **English**. Additional language support is on our roadmap. If you need other languages, please let us know in the support forum!

= Does this make my site WCAG compliant? =

The plugin helps with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA image text alternative requirements** (Success Criterion 1.1.1). However, full WCAG compliance involves many factors beyond alt text:
* Page structure
* Color contrast
* Keyboard navigation
* Form labels
* Video captions
* And more...

For complete accessibility audits, consider tools like WAVE, axe, or hiring an accessibility consultant.

= Can I use this on multiple sites? =

**Yes!** Your account can be used on multiple WordPress installations. Each site connects independently, and your monthly quota is shared across all sites.

For agencies managing many client sites, we offer **Agency Plans** with higher quotas and multi-site management features. [Contact sales](https://alttextai.com/contact) for details.

= What if I'm not satisfied? =

We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee** on all Pro plans. If you're not happy, email support@alttextai.com and we'll refund you—no questions asked.

= How do I upgrade to Pro? =

Upgrading is easy:
1. Go to **Media > AI Alt Text**
2. Click the **"Upgrade to Pro"** button
3. Choose your plan (monthly or annual)
4. Enter payment details
5. Start generating immediately!

Existing free tier usage stays intact, and your Pro quota activates instantly.

**Yes, anytime!** Cancel directly from:
* The plugin dashboard ("Manage Subscription" button)
* Your account portal at alttextai.com
* Email support@alttextai.com

No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime, effective at your next billing date.

* 🔒 **Authentication**: JWT token-based secure authentication
* 🔒 **No Storage**: Images are processed in real-time, never stored
* 🔒 **GDPR Compliant**: Full data control and deletion rights

* ✅ Quick edit

= Does this work with multisite? =

**Yes!** The plugin is multisite compatible. Install network-wide or per-site. Each site connects independently with its own usage tracking.

= Can I batch process images via code? =

**Yes!** The plugin includes **WP-CLI support**:

```bash
# Dry run (see what would be processed)
wp ai-alt bulk-generate --dry-run

# Process all images missing alt text
wp ai-alt bulk-generate --confirm

# Process specific images
wp ai-alt generate 123 456 789

# Get stats
wp ai-alt stats
```

See our [developer documentation](https://alttextai.com/docs/developers) for API usage.

== Additional Info ==

### Why Accessibility Matters

**The Numbers:**
* 1 in 4 adults in the US has a disability (CDC)
* 98% of websites fail basic accessibility standards (WebAIM)
* $6.9 billion in revenue lost annually due to inaccessible sites
* Screen reader usage growing 10% year-over-year

**The Impact:**
* Expand your audience by making content available to everyone
* Improve SEO and search engine rankings
* Demonstrate corporate social responsibility
* Reduce legal risk (ADA compliance)
* Enhance user experience for all visitors

### About Alt Text

**Alt text (alternative text)** is a short description of an image that:
* Appears when images fail to load
* Is read aloud by screen readers for blind/low-vision users
* Helps search engines understand image content
* Provides context in text-only browsers

**Best Practices:**
* Keep it concise (aim for < 125 characters)
* Describe the content AND context
* Don't start with "image of" or "picture of"
* Include relevant keywords naturally
* Skip decorative images (use empty alt="")
* Be specific and accurate

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: `alt="image"`
❌ Bad: `alt="dog.jpg"`
✅ Good: `alt="Golden retriever puppy playing with red ball in grass"`

❌ Bad: `alt="product"`
✅ Good: `alt="Blue ceramic coffee mug with white handle, 12oz capacity"`

Our AI follows these best practices automatically!

### Legal & Compliance

This plugin helps meet:
* **WCAG 2.1** Level A & AA (Success Criterion 1.1.1)
* **Section 508** (US federal accessibility requirements)
* **ADA** (Americans with Disabilities Act)
* **EN 301 549** (European accessibility standard)
* **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**

**Note:** This plugin addresses image accessibility specifically. Full compliance requires additional measures beyond alt text.
