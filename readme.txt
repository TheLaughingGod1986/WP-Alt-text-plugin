== Description ==

**Stop losing traffic from Google Images. Fix missing alt text automatically in seconds.**

Every image without alt text is a missed opportunity. Google can't index your images properly. Visitors using screen readers can't understand your content. Your SEO rankings suffer. And manually writing thousands of alt descriptions? That's weeks of work.

**Here's what happens when you install BeepBeep AI:**

Within minutes, you can generate alt text for hundreds of images automatically. Every description is:
* **SEO-optimized** — Uses keywords Google understands to boost your image search rankings
