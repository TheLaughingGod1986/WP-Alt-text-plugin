== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an OpenAI API key? =

No! This plugin uses a secure proxy API so you don't need to manage your own OpenAI key. You get 10 free generations per month automatically.

= What counts as a "generation"? =

Each time the plugin creates alt text for an image, that counts as one generation. Regenerating alt text for the same image counts as a new generation.

= Can I edit the generated alt text? =

Absolutely! All generated alt text can be edited directly in the Media Library or from the ALT Library tab in the plugin dashboard.

= Will this work with my page builder? =

Yes! The plugin adds alt text directly to WordPress media items, so it works with any page builder, theme, or plugin that uses the standard WordPress media library.

= What happens when I reach my monthly limit? =

You'll see a notification when approaching your limit. You can either wait for the monthly reset or upgrade to Pro for higher limits.

= Does this slow down my site? =

No. Alt text generation happens asynchronously and doesn't affect your site's frontend performance. The plugin is optimized for speed and efficiency.

= Is the AI-generated alt text WCAG compliant? =

The plugin generates descriptive, concise alt text following accessibility best practices. However, we always recommend reviewing important images to ensure they meet your specific context and requirements.

= Can I use this for WooCommerce products? =

Yes! The plugin works great for WooCommerce product images and can help you quickly add alt text to your entire catalog.

= What if I'm not happy with the generated alt text? =

You can regenerate alt text as many times as needed (each counts toward your monthly quota), or manually edit any description. The plugin includes quality scoring to help identify descriptions that need review.
