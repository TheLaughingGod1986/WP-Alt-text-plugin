## Technical Decisions

### Why Proxy API?

**Security:**
- Users never see/handle OpenAI API key
- No risk of key exposure in WordPress database
- Easier to revoke/rotate keys

**Monetization:**
- Control usage limits server-side
- Prevent abuse (can't bypass by changing key)
- Track usage accurately

**User Experience:**
- No configuration required
- Works out of the box
- Simpler setup process

### Why JSON Database for MVP?

**Speed:**
- No database setup required
- Deploy in minutes
- Easy to backup/restore

**Simplicity:**
- Single file to manage
- Easy to inspect/debug
- No migrations needed

**Good Enough:**
- Handles 1,000s of users fine
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL later
- MVP doesn't need complexity

### Why Monthly Limits?

**User Friendly:**
- Clear quota everyone understands
- Predictable reset schedule
- Time-based urgency for upgrades

**Business:**
- Consistent revenue opportunity
- Easy to communicate value
- Standard SaaS model

### Why Hashed Domains?

**Privacy:**
- Don't store actual domain names
- GDPR-friendly
- Unique identifier still maintained

**Security:**
- Can't be reverse-engineered
- Protects customer information
