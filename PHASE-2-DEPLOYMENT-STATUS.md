## Detailed Status for Each Task

### 1. ❌ Switch Stripe Keys from Test to Live

**Current Status:**
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_placeholder_key_for_testing
```

**What's Done:**
- Stripe price IDs are configured (Pro, Agency, Credits)
- Test environment is set up
- All Stripe integration code is complete

**What's Needed:**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Get your **live** secret key (starts with `sk_live_`)
3. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_live_key
   ```
4. Restart the backend server

**Impact:** Currently can only process test payments, no real revenue

---

### 2. ⚠️ Configure Production CORS/Domain (PARTIAL)

**Current Status:**
```javascript
// server-v2.js line 24
app.use(cors()); // Accepts ALL origins
```

```bash
# .env
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # Placeholder
```

**What's Done:**
- CORS middleware is installed
- Server is ready for production

**What's Needed:**
1. Determine your actual WordPress site URL
2. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-actual-wordpress-site.com
   ```
3. Update CORS configuration in `server-v2.js` to restrict to your domain:
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors({
     origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://your-wordpress-site.com',
     credentials: true
   }));
   ```

**Impact:** Security risk - any website can currently make requests to your API

---

### 3. ❌ Set Up Stripe Webhooks

**Current Status:**
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_afe6685be32f1b21c346ac82861593e1fa8ea4d5d2e412a9bcf74a6b938e2588
```

**What's Done:**
- Webhook endpoint exists: `POST /billing/webhook`
- Webhook handler code is complete
- Can handle all subscription events
- Webhook secret is in .env (but might be outdated)

**What's Needed:**
1. Deploy backend to production (Render/Railway)
2. Get your production URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`)
3. Go to [Stripe Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
4. Click "Add endpoint"
5. Set URL: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/billing/webhook`
6. Select events to listen to:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
7. Copy the new webhook signing secret
8. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_new_signing_secret
   ```

**Impact:** Subscriptions won't auto-renew, cancellations won't work, payment failures won't be handled

---

### 4. ❌ Update WordPress Plugin to Phase 2

**Current Status:**
- Plugin version: **3.1.0** (Phase 1)
- Using: **Domain-based** authentication (old system)
- Missing: JWT authentication, user login/registration UI
- API calls still using: `domain` parameter

**Current API Client:**
```php
// class-api-client.php
$this->api_url = $options['api_url'] ?? 'https://alttext-ai-backend.onrender.com';
$this->domain = $this->get_site_domain(); // Still using domain!
```

**What's Done:**
- Backend API is ready for JWT authentication
- All Phase 2 endpoints are working locally

**What's Needed:**

#### Option A: Major Plugin Update (Recommended)
Create new plugin version with:
1. User authentication UI (login/register modals)
2. JWT token storage and management
3. Authorization headers on all API requests
4. Dashboard showing user plan, usage, and billing
5. Upgrade prompts and Stripe checkout integration

**Files to update:**
- `ai-alt-gpt.php` - Add authentication UI
- `includes/class-api-client.php` - Add JWT support
- `assets/ai-alt-admin.js` - Add auth logic
- `assets/ai-alt-dashboard.js` - Add billing UI

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

#### Option B: Gradual Migration
1. Keep Phase 1 working for existing users
2. Add optional Phase 2 authentication
3. Migrate users gradually

**Impact:** Users cannot create accounts or use Phase 2 features. Plugin is essentially non-functional with Phase 2 backend.

### 5. ❌ Test End-to-End Flow

**What Can't Be Tested Yet:**
- ❌ User registration from WordPress
- ❌ User login from WordPress
- ❌ Alt text generation with JWT
- ❌ Usage tracking
- ❌ Upgrade flow
- ❌ Stripe checkout
- ❌ Subscription management

**What CAN Be Tested Now:**
- ✅ Backend API endpoints (all working locally)
- ✅ Database connection
- ✅ JWT authentication (via cURL)
- ✅ Usage tracking (via API)

```

**Current Users:** 5 test users
**Status:** ✅ Fully operational

---

## Backend Server Status

**Running locally on:** `http://localhost:3001`
**Version:** 2.0.0 (Monetization)
**Health Check:** ✅ Passing

---

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Required for Launch)
1. **Update WordPress Plugin** (4-6 hours)
   - Add JWT authentication
   - Add user login/register UI
   - Update API client to use Phase 2 endpoints

2. **Deploy Backend to Production** (30 minutes)
   - Deploy to Render/Railway
   - Update environment variables with production URLs

3. **Configure Stripe Live Keys** (15 minutes)
   - Get live keys from Stripe
   - Update .env

4. **Set Up Stripe Webhooks** (15 minutes)
   - Create webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard
   - Update webhook secret

### Secondary (Recommended)
5. **Configure Production CORS** (10 minutes)
   - Restrict to your WordPress domain
   - Update FRONTEND_URL

6. **End-to-End Testing** (1-2 hours)
   - Test complete user flow
   - Test subscription lifecycle
   - Test edge cases

### Nice to Have
7. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Add error tracking (Sentry)
   - Set up uptime monitoring

8. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - API documentation

---

## Blockers

### Critical Blockers (Must Fix)
1. ❌ **WordPress plugin not updated** - Blocks all testing and launch
2. ❌ **Backend not deployed to production** - Users can't access it
3. ❌ **Using test Stripe keys** - Can't process real payments

### Non-Critical (Can Launch Without)
1. ⚠️ **Stripe webhooks not configured** - Subscriptions won't auto-renew
2. ⚠️ **CORS not restricted** - Security concern but not blocking

---

## Summary

**Backend Phase 2:** ✅ Complete and tested
**WordPress Plugin:** ❌ Still on Phase 1
**Production Deployment:** ❌ Not deployed
**Ready to Launch:** ❌ NO

**Estimated Time to Launch:** 6-8 hours of development work

**The main blocker is the WordPress plugin update.** Once that's done, deployment and configuration will take less than 2 hours.

## Testing Evidence

### Backend API Tests (All Passing ✅)
```bash
✅ Health check: 200 OK
✅ User registration: 201 Created
✅ User login: 200 OK
✅ Get user info: 200 OK
✅ Get usage: 200 OK
✅ Get billing plans: 200 OK
✅ Usage history: 200 OK
```

### Database Connection (✅)
```
✅ Database connected successfully!
   Total users: 5
```

---

**Bottom Line:** Phase 2 backend is production-ready, but the WordPress plugin needs significant updates before anything can launch.
