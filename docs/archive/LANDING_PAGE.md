## FAQ SECTION (SEO-Optimized)

### 1. How does AI-generated alt text improve my SEO?

AI-generated alt text includes relevant keywords that help Google understand and rank your images in Google Images search results. Properly optimized alt text can increase organic traffic from image searches by 20-30%.

### 2. Will my images appear in Google Images search?

Yes. Google uses alt text to index and rank images. Images with optimized alt text appear more frequently in Google Images search results, driving additional organic traffic to your site.

### 3. Is the generated alt text WCAG compliant?

Yes. Every AI-generated description meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Our quality scoring ensures alt text is descriptive, accurate, and helpful for screen reader users.

### 4. How accurate is the AI-generated alt text?

Our AI models achieve 99%+ accuracy on descriptive alt text. Every description appears in an editable preview before saving, so you can review and adjust as needed.

### 5. Is my image data secure and private?

Yes. Images are transmitted securely via HTTPS to our API for processing. We don't store your images permanently—descriptions are generated and returned immediately. No personal data is collected.

### 6. Can I edit the AI-generated descriptions?

Absolutely. Every AI-generated description appears in an editable preview before saving. Review, improve, add keywords, or completely rewrite as needed. You maintain full control.

### 7. How many images can I process at once?

With Pro or Agency plans, you can process unlimited images. Bulk select your entire media library and generate alt text for thousands of images in one operation.

### 8. Does this work with WooCommerce product images?

Yes. BeepBeep AI works with all WordPress images including WooCommerce products, featured images, gallery images, and any images in your media library.

### 9. Will this slow down my website?

No. Generation happens in the background using our secure API. Your website performance is unaffected. Bulk processing uses a queue system that won't impact page load times.

### 10. What happens to my existing alt text?

Existing alt text is preserved by default. The plugin only adds alt text to images that don't have it, or when you explicitly choose to regenerate. Your current descriptions remain untouched.

Yes. The free plan includes 50 AI-generated alt texts monthly with full functionality. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited generations. There are no feature restrictions on the free plan.

Your quota resets on the first of each month. You can also upgrade to Pro for unlimited generations at any time. Free plan users can process hundreds of images over several months.

### 13. Does this work with page builders like Elementor or Divi?

Yes. BeepBeep AI works with any WordPress theme or page builder because it adds alt text directly to images in the WordPress media library. Once an image has alt text, it appears everywhere.

### 14. Can I cancel my subscription anytime?

Yes. Cancel anytime from your account settings. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Your plan remains active until the end of your billing period.

### 15. What languages are supported?

Currently optimized for English. Alt text generation works best with English content, but the plugin interface supports WordPress translation files for international users.

## BRANDING TONE NOTES

### Voice & Tone

**Confident:**
Speak with authority about SEO and accessibility benefits. Use data-backed claims (22% of traffic from Google Images, 10+ hours saved).

**Clear:**
7th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon. Focus on outcomes, not technical features.

**Benefit-First:**
Always lead with what users get (time saved, rankings improved, compliance achieved) before explaining how it works.

**Reassuring:**
Emphasize security (Stripe, HTTPS), privacy (no personal data), and flexibility (cancel anytime, free tier available).

### Key Messaging Pillars

**Pillar 1: Time Savings**
"Save 10+ hours monthly" appears throughout. Position manual alt text writing as outdated and time-consuming.

**Pillar 2: SEO Performance**
"Boost Google Images rankings" emphasizes the SEO benefit. Use statistics (22% of Google traffic) to build credibility.

**Pillar 3: Accessibility Compliance**
"WCAG 2.1 AA compliant" protects against lawsuits. Frame accessibility as both legal protection and user experience improvement.

**Pillar 4: Automation**
"Automatically" and "instantly" appear frequently. Position the plugin as set-it-and-forget-it automation.

### Conversion Psychology

**Value Stacking:**
Layer benefits (SEO + accessibility + time savings) to show comprehensive value.

**Social Proof:**
"2,000+ WordPress sites" provides credibility without exaggeration.

**Risk Removal:**
"Cancel anytime", "Free tier available", "Secure Stripe checkout" reduce purchase anxiety.

**Urgency (Soft):**
"Stop losing traffic" creates urgency without aggressive tactics. "Start now" encourages immediate action.

## FAQ SECTION (SEO-Optimized)

### 1. How does AI-generated alt text improve my SEO?

AI-generated alt text includes relevant keywords that help Google understand and rank your images in Google Images search results. Properly optimized alt text can increase organic traffic from image searches by 20-30%.

### 2. Will my images appear in Google Images search?

Yes. Google uses alt text to index and rank images. Images with optimized alt text appear more frequently in Google Images search results, driving additional organic traffic to your site.

### 3. Is the generated alt text WCAG compliant?

Yes. Every AI-generated description meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Our quality scoring ensures alt text is descriptive, accurate, and helpful for screen reader users.

### 4. How accurate is the AI-generated alt text?

Our AI models achieve 99%+ accuracy on descriptive alt text. Every description appears in an editable preview before saving, so you can review and adjust as needed.

### 5. Is my image data secure and private?

Yes. Images are transmitted securely via HTTPS to our API for processing. We don't store your images permanently—descriptions are generated and returned immediately. No personal data is collected.

### 6. Can I edit the AI-generated descriptions?

Absolutely. Every AI-generated description appears in an editable preview before saving. Review, improve, add keywords, or completely rewrite as needed. You maintain full control.

### 7. How many images can I process at once?

With Pro or Agency plans, you can process unlimited images. Bulk select your entire media library and generate alt text for thousands of images in one operation.

### 8. Does this work with WooCommerce product images?

Yes. BeepBeep AI works with all WordPress images including WooCommerce products, featured images, gallery images, and any images in your media library.

### 9. Will this slow down my website?

No. Generation happens in the background using our secure API. Your website performance is unaffected. Bulk processing uses a queue system that won't impact page load times.

### 10. What happens to my existing alt text?

Existing alt text is preserved by default. The plugin only adds alt text to images that don't have it, or when you explicitly choose to regenerate. Your current descriptions remain untouched.

### 11. Can I use this without paying?

Yes. The free plan includes 50 AI-generated alt texts monthly with full functionality. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited generations. There are no feature restrictions on the free plan.

### 12. What if I run out of free generations?

Your quota resets on the first of each month. You can also upgrade to Pro for unlimited generations at any time. Free plan users can process hundreds of images over several months.

### 13. Does this work with page builders like Elementor or Divi?

Yes. BeepBeep AI works with any WordPress theme or page builder because it adds alt text directly to images in the WordPress media library. Once an image has alt text, it appears everywhere.

### 14. Can I cancel my subscription anytime?

Yes. Cancel anytime from your account settings. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Your plan remains active until the end of your billing period.

### 15. What languages are supported?

Currently optimized for English. Alt text generation works best with English content, but the plugin interface supports WordPress translation files for international users.

## BRANDING TONE NOTES

### Voice & Tone

**Confident:**
Speak with authority about SEO and accessibility benefits. Use data-backed claims (22% of traffic from Google Images, 10+ hours saved).

**Clear:**
7th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon. Focus on outcomes, not technical features.

**Benefit-First:**
Always lead with what users get (time saved, rankings improved, compliance achieved) before explaining how it works.

**Reassuring:**
Emphasize security (Stripe, HTTPS), privacy (no personal data), and flexibility (cancel anytime, free tier available).

### Key Messaging Pillars

**Pillar 1: Time Savings**
"Save 10+ hours monthly" appears throughout. Position manual alt text writing as outdated and time-consuming.

**Pillar 2: SEO Performance**
"Boost Google Images rankings" emphasizes the SEO benefit. Use statistics (22% of Google traffic) to build credibility.

**Pillar 3: Accessibility Compliance**
"WCAG 2.1 AA compliant" protects against lawsuits. Frame accessibility as both legal protection and user experience improvement.

**Pillar 4: Automation**
"Automatically" and "instantly" appear frequently. Position the plugin as set-it-and-forget-it automation.

### Conversion Psychology

**Value Stacking:**
Layer benefits (SEO + accessibility + time savings) to show comprehensive value.

**Social Proof:**
"2,000+ WordPress sites" provides credibility without exaggeration.

**Risk Removal:**
"Cancel anytime", "Free tier available", "Secure Stripe checkout" reduce purchase anxiety.

**Urgency (Soft):**
"Stop losing traffic" creates urgency without aggressive tactics. "Start now" encourages immediate action.
