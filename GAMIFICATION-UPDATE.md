## 🎨 Customization Options

### For Developers

Want to adjust the gamification? Easy!

**Change XP Per Level:**

// In ai-alt-dashboard.js, line 13
calculateLevel(imagesProcessed) {
    return Math.floor(imagesProcessed / 50) + 1;  // Change 50
}
```

**Modify Achievements:**
```javascript
// In ai-alt-dashboard.js, line 48
achievements: [
    {
        id: 'custom_achievement',
        title: 'Your Title',
        description: 'Your description',
        emoji: '🎯',
        requirement: 25,  // Your number
        check: (stats) => stats.generated >= 25
    }
]
```

**Adjust Colors:**
```css
/* In ai-alt-dashboard.css, line 6 */
:root {
    --farlo-gradient-1: linear-gradient(...);  /* Change gradients */
