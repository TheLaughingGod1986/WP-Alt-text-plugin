### What Your Costs Look Like

**OpenAI Costs (GPT-4o-mini):**
- Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens
- Average alt text generation: ~500 input + 100 output tokens = $0.00015
- **1,000 generations = ~$0.15 in OpenAI costs**

**Hosting:**
- Railway/Render: $0-5/month (free tier to start)

**Your margin on Pro ($9/month):**
- Revenue: $9
- OpenAI cost: ~$0.15

## Monitoring Success

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Installations**: Check WordPress.org plugin page
2. **Active Installations**: Track in stats
3. **Generations per Day**: Monitor API `db.json`
4. **Conversion Rate**: % of users who hit limit and upgrade
5. **Revenue**: Track via Gumroad/payment platform

### API Monitoring

```bash
# Check total usage across all users
ssh into your server
cd backend
cat db.json | grep -o '"count":[0-9]*' | wc -l
```

### Set Up Alerts

- **Uptime**: UptimeRobot for API health checks
- **Errors**: Check logs daily for first week
- **Revenue**: Gumroad email notifications

## Support Plan

### Free Users
- Direct to WordPress.org support forum
- You answer 1-2x per week
- Update FAQ as common questions arise

### Pro Users
- Priority email support
- Aim for 24-hour response time
- Consider Intercom/Help Scout when > 50 Pro users

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "API not responding"
â†’ Check Railway/Render logs, verify API key is set

### "Monthly limit reached" 
â†’ Check if it's actually end of month, offer Pro upgrade

### "Alt text is low quality"
â†’ Explain you can regenerate, or edit manually

### "Can I use my own OpenAI key?"
â†’ "Pro plan uses advanced GPT-4 model for better quality"

## Next Phase Plans

Once you have **20-50 Pro users**, consider:

1. **User Dashboard**: Let users manage their own account
2. **Stripe Integration**: Automated billing
3. **License Keys**: Self-service upgrades
4. **Agency Plan**: Multiple domains
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Per-user limits
6. **Email Automation**: Welcome, renewal reminders
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage graphs, quality trends
